# JournalApp
CS481

Coder:
Evan Ross 

Each activity has a seperate xml file for both orientations

Points:

SQLite database

Notifcations

Shake on "Your Journal" page

Read/Write to internal storage for "Thoughts" page



Only tested on Samsung S9 (2960x1440:xxxhdpi)
Won't line up properly on smaller phone screens




How the app works!



Click the Add New Entries to add to the sqlite database

Click on them from the list in order to see all of the details

Either shake the device or press the top left button to get a random entry to show up


Click on the Your Journal to take you to the Thoughts page (works the other way around also)

Type stuff and press Add to add it to the .dat file
